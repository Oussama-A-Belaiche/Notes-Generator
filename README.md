# Notes-Generator
The Notes Generator is a simple web application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes dynamically. The app generates notes that can be easily added by clicking the "Add Note" button. Each note has a text area where users can input their content, and each note includes a "Delete" button to remove it.
